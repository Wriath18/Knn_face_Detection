Here's a README code template for your face detection project, incorporating key details and guidance:

# Face Detection with KNN Algorithm

## Overview

This project demonstrates face detection using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and stores the data in a NumPy file and uses that data to remember the face of the person along with their name.

## Key Files

Face_detection_data.ipynb: Contains the Python code for face detection, training, and data storage.
face_data.npy: Stores the collected face data in NumPy array format.
## Prerequisites

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
NumPy library
